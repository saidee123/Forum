MMU Forum is a web application that aims to provide a platform for mmu students or lecturers to be able to discuss and communicate with each other. MMU has a lot of website such as MMLS, mmu portal, camsys and many more but none of them provide a platform to discuss about MMU in general. There will be three types of users, lecturer/staff, students and admin. Student and lecturer will be able to create the topic but lecturer will be able sticky their post which will make their post stay on top. Admin can do what lecturer and student able to but only admin can ban other user. With this application, student and lecturer should be able to learn, help and communicate with each other more easily than ever before.
